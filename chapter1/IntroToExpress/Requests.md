# Basic Requests

GET: The GET method is used to retrieve data from a server. It sends a request to the server asking for a specific resource, such as a web page or a file, and the server responds by sending the requested resource back to the client.

POST: The POST method is used to submit data to a server. It sends a request to the server with the data in the message body, and the server responds by processing the data and returning a response.

DELETE: The DELETE method is used to delete a resource on the server. It sends a request to the server asking to delete a specific resource, and the server responds by deleting the resource if it exists.

PUT: The PUT method is used to update a resource on the server. It sends a request to the server with the updated data in the message body, and the server responds by updating the resource if it exists.

These HTTP methods are part of the HTTP protocol, which is the foundation of the World Wide Web. They are commonly used in RESTful APIs to allow clients to interact with servers and manipulate resources. Understanding how these methods work and when to use them is essential for web developers who want to build scalable and efficient web applications.
