# Background on req and res objects in Express

In the Express example we created earlier, __req__ and __res__ are variables that represent the incoming request and outgoing response objects, respectively.

The req object, short for __request__ contains information about the incoming request, such as the HTTP method, headers, URL, and any data sent with the request. It also provides access to parameters and query string values passed in the URL, as well as any data sent with a __POST__ or __PUT__ request.

The res object short for __response__ contains information about the server's response to the incoming request, such as the HTTP status code, headers, and the body of the response. It is used to send data back to the client in response to the request, such as HTML, JSON, or other types of data.

In our example, we used the req and res objects in our route handlers to handle incoming requests and send appropriate responses back to the client. For example, we used req.params to access parameters passed in the URL, and res.send() to send data back to the client in response to the request.

Overall, understanding how to use the req and res objects is essential for building robust and scalable web applications with Express.
