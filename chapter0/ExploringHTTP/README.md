# Exploring HTTP Requests with a Web Browser

Before we start learning about fundamental backend technologies it is important to understand the basic terminologies about requests and responses in http.

## What are you going to learn?

By completing this exercise, you'll gain a better understanding of how HTTP requests and responses work and how they're used to retrieve and display content on webpages. You'll also learn about the different types of HTTP requests and how to view and analyze them using your browser's developer tools.

## Tasks

### Browse to a website
Open your web browser and navigate to a website, such as google.com.

### Inspect
Open the developer tools in your browser. This is typically done by right-clicking on the webpage and selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element".

1. Select the "Network" tab in the developer tools. This will display all the HTTP requests and responses made by the webpage.
2. Refresh the webpage and observe the requests and responses in the Network tab. You should see requests for the webpage's HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and any other resources used by the page.

### Analyze
Click on a request in the Network tab to view more details about the request and response. You should be able to see the request method (e.g. GET or POST), the URL, and any headers or parameters included in the request. You can also view the response status, headers, and content.

### Repeat  
Try making different types of requests by interacting with the webpage. For example, submitting a search query or filling out a form.

### Hints
* Before starting this exercise, it may be helpful to review some background material on HTTP requests and responses, such as the HTTP/1.1 specification or an introductory tutorial on HTTP.
* Make sure to clear the Network tab before refreshing the webpage, so you can easily see the new requests and responses.
* Experiment with different options in the developer tools, such as filtering requests by type or searching for specific requests.
* Some websites may use HTTPS instead of HTTP, which encrypts the requests and responses. In this case, you may not be able to view the full details of the requests and responses.
* Have a really deep dive to the background materials. They will help you understanding the topic very well.
