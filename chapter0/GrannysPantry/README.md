# Granny's Pantry

Little Red Riding Hood's granny learned the lesson and digitized her pantry, to make ordering online easier. Problem is, she did not receive a full documentation, nor a frontend, so she needs help administrating the items in her pantry.

## What are you going to learn?

* Create requests using Postman.
* Create collections of requests using Postman.
* Use variables in Postman.


## Tasks

### Create a Postman account
Create an account at [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). You can download the client or use the app from the browser

1. A Postman account is created.

### Create a Pantry
Create a Pantry for your email at [Pantry](https://getpantry.cloud/). Keep your **Pantry id**, as it is important later.

1. There is an ID for the Pantry.

### Create a Workspace
Create a new **Workspace** in Postman, where you can organize your collection of requests.

1. There is at least one workspace in Postman.


### Create a Collection  
Create a collection named **Granny's Pantry** in Postman, for storing requests in this project.

1. There is a collection in Postman named **Granny's Pantry**


### Check your Pantry

Check the details of your Pantry by creating a **GET** request to **https://getpantry.cloud/apiv1/pantry/<YOUR_PANTRY_ID>** using Postman. Save this request to your collection, and name it **Get details**.

1. There is a GET request named **Get details** saved into the collection.
2. The response status is 200 OK.

### Create a Basket in the Pantry
* Create a new Basket in your Pantry by creating a **POST** request to **https://getpantry.cloud/apiv1/pantry/<YOUR_PANTRY_ID>/basket/<YOUR_BASKET_NAME>** using Postman. Save this request to your collection, and name it **Create new basket**.

1. There is a POST request named Create new basket saved into the collection.
2. The response status is 200 OK.

### Introducing variables
Create a collection variable for the **base URL** (**https://getpantry.cloud/apiv1/pantry/**), named **pantry_api_path**. Create a collection variable for your Pantry ID, named **pantry_id**. Create a collection variable for your Basket, named **basket_name**. Use these variables in all of your requests. When you rewrite your previous ones, make sure they're still functional.

1. There is a variable named **pantry_api_path** for the API path, used in all requests in the collection.
2. There is a variable named **pantry_id** for your Pantry id, used in all requests in the collection.
3. There is a variable named **basket_name** for your Basket, used in all affected requests in the collection.
4. Variables are used in all requests.

### Fill the basket
Fill the Basket by sending a **PUT** request to **https://getpantry.cloud/apiv1/pantry/<YOUR_PANTRY_ID>/basket/<YOUR_BASKET_NAME>** using Postman. The request body **JSON** must contain the **{"fruits": ["apple", "banana", "peach"]}** expression. Name the request as **Fill Basket**.

1. There is a **PUT** request named **Fill Basket** saved into the collection.
2. The response status is 200 OK.

### Check the basket
Check the content of the basket by sending a **GET** request to **https://getpantry.cloud/apiv1/pantry/<YOUR_PANTRY_ID>/basket/<YOUR_BASKET_NAME>** using Postman. Name the request as **Get content of basket**.

1. There is a **GET** request named **Get content of basket** saved into the Collection.Â´
2. The response status is 200 OK.

### Delete the basket
Delete the whole basket by sending a **DELETE** request to **https://getpantry.cloud/apiv1/pantry/<YOUR_PANTRY_ID>/basket/<YOUR_BASKET_NAME>** using Postman. Name the request as **Delete basket**.

1. There is a **DELETE** request named **Delete basket** saved into the Collection.
2. The response status is 200 OK.


### Create a new Folder
Create a new Folder in your collection using Postman, and name it **Restore Basket**. Add the **Create new basket**, **Get content of basket**, **Fill basket** requests to this folder.


1. There is a folder named "Restore basket".
2. The folder contains the **Create new basket**, Get content of basket, **and** Fill basket` requests.


### Restore basket
Lucky we've created variables! Restore the previously deleted basket by running all requests in your **Restore Basket** folder, without editing anything.


1. The API path, Pantry ID, and Basket name are stored in variables, used in all requests.
2. By only running the folder, the basket described in the tasks can be restored.


### Test the Collection
Copy the content of **postman_tests.js**, located in the starter repository, to the **Tests** of the collection. All tests must pass.

1. All tests are copied to the collection tests.
2. All tests pass.


### Export Collection
By exporting your work, anyone can import it and use your collection, which can be extremely useful. Export your collection and put it in your Git repo.

1. The collection is exported into a JSON file.
2. The collection can be found in the remote repository.
